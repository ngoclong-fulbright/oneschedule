How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society? The course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time.

Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape. \\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent.  \\nLearning Objectives: \\n1.Understand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\n2.Compare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\n3.Analyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation. \\n4.Evaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\n5.Craft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.","notes":"Faculty: Andrew Harold Bellisari\u2013 E: andrew.bellisari@fulbright.edu.vn\\nLevel: Intermediate/Advanced\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No. Students are highly recommended to take at least one foundation course in History.

The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\\n- Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\n- Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\n- Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\\n- Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\\n- Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.","notes":"Faculty: Core teaching team\\nLevel: Core\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-campus\\n","schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"3:00PM","end_time":"4:30PM"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"3:00PM","end_time":"4:30PM"}]},{"id":"IS301_Fall2021_S01","title":"Computational Chemistry and ChemInformatics","credits":4,"instructor":"Phan Vu Xuan Hung","description":"In this era, we frequently turn to a computer for a variety of tasks, from simply converting inches to centimeters to producing sophisticated music and movies.

However, the economy is also embedded in a great variety of human cultures and circumstances. Religious values powerfully shape economic choices; habits and customs guide economic decision-making; circumstances and status constrain action and outcomes. Observable variety in economic forms and fortunes in the modern world reflect diversity in the values that people have brought to their economic endeavours, as well as in the capacities and strategies that they as economic actors have used to realise their desires. In other words, the economy is entwined in life, culture, and society, and must be studied in such contexts. This course introduces classic social science theories that explore the relationship between culture and the economy. Focussing on the market economy in modern Asia, it examines the cultural dispositions that have encouraged, retarded, and reshaped the development of capitalist market relations in this region. With case studies drawn from a range of countries and cultural milieux, it examines how the transition to the market has been enabled and experienced. As a user\'s guide to the market economy in Asia it uncovers the variety of ways that local actors have maintained, adapted and instrumentalised culture to make a living. It examines economic complexity: how local values shape the economy; how people limit the impact of the market in their lives; and how they conceptualise, cope with and challenge marketisation.

This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.
