They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\nSample Topic Schedule\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nDemonstrate a basic understanding of the video making process.\\nDevelop comprehension of non-linear editing concepts and practical competency in the usage of non-linear video-editing software. \\nDevelop skills in basic script writing format and an understanding of filmic narrative structure.\\nDemonstrate competency in oral presentation and studio critique.\\nAcquire introductory knowledge of seminal video artworks and experimental films.\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance and Participation:15%\\nVideo Project, Individual: One video with duration of less than 5-minutes made using only found footage. 30%\\nPresentation and critique session for 5-minute video. 10%\\nFinal video project, Individual: One final video with duration of less than 10 minutes, using footage shot by the student. 35%\\nPresentation and critique session for 10-minute video final project. 10%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Special Topics in Contemporary Art: Post-Asia","id":"ARTS301_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Pamela Corey","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NgQAJ/arts301fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Pamela Corey - E: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: ARTS101 \u2013 Introduction to Visual Studies.

Instead of geographically mapping these practices and artists by nation or region, we will examine selected case studies and specific artworks through such thematic and conceptual topics as the Body, Painting, Technology, Archive, Scale, and Voice. What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be \'the Asian century\', the term \u2018Post-Asia\u2019 thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the \u2018East vs West\u2019 binary.","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}]},{"title":"Global Humanities and Social Change","id":"CORE101_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Core Teaching Team","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NSQAZ/core101fall2021s01","description":"Category: Core\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course examines key moments in the global history of thought through the lens of textual analysis.

This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

Through the Fulbright Scholar Development program, these students will earn 4 credits, equivalent to one full-time course, as they complete this academic internship. \\nThese student scholars will engage in a variety of tasks and activities intended to provide them with a holistic academic experience. Much of the experience will revolve around the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. Student scholars will create materials, support lectures, run tutorials, aid with experiments, and participate in weekly meetings and online discussions.  \\nIn addition to running this course with Graeme, student scholars will also have the opportunity to develop their own research ideas based on lessons from the course. For each topic covered in Principles of Economics I, student scholars will be given additional readings and resources intended to deepen their knowledge on the topic and provoke research ideas. \\nAt the end of the Fall term, student scholars will submit either a literature review or project proposal. Student scholars will also have to complete a reflection on the experience. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of the Fall term, student scholars will be able to:\\n\u2022 clearly communicate theoretical and methodological approaches to economic issues\\n\u2022 use strategies and instructional methods to effectively lead small groups in discussions and activities\\n\u2022 formulate research questions founded in economic theory\\n\u2022 evaluate and test theoretical models\\n\u2022 analyze and interpret experimental data\\n---\\nExpected Workload:\\nStudent scholars will begin working with Graeme during the week of September 27, 2021 to help prepare for the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. From the week of September 27 to October 15, student time will be divided between meetings, workshops, and course set-up as follows:\\nMeetings (2 hrs/week): Meetings during these three weeks will be devoted to getting organized and checking in on progress with activities related to setting up the course. Each week there will be a one-hour meeting with all students as well as meetings with sub-groups of students working on different aspects of the course.\\nWorkshops (2 hrs/week): Each week we will hold a two-hour teaching workshop where students will lead portions of lessons or activities that they have helped develop. During these sessions, all students will participate and Graeme will provide feedback on the delivery of the lessons/activities. The goal of these workshops is to help students become comfortable leading small groups through online activities.\\nCourse Set-up (6 hrs/week): Student scholars may be asked to update slides, create reading lists, develop homework documents, and set-up Canvas. Student scholars will be assigned various topics from the course and asked to work either individually or in small groups to ensure all materials needed for the course are ready before the Fall term begins. Once the Fall term begins, from the week of October 17, 2021 until January 14, 2022, student scholars will be spend their time in class, meetings, office hours, and on research-related activities, as follows:\\nClass Time (3 hrs/week): Principles of Economics I will have class on Monday and Wednesday. Each session will run for 90 minutes. Monday\u2019s session will be run by Graeme while Wednesday\u2019s session will be primarily run by student scholars as tutorials. These tutorials will primarily address the weekly homework, but may also involve discussion-based activities that student scholars will facilitate.\\nMeetings (2 hr/week): We will meet once per week for two hours. During this time we will debrief on the week\u2019s lecture and tutorial, prepare for the following week\u2019s lesson, and discuss the related literature on the coming topics.\\nOffice Hours (1 hr/week): Each student scholar will be required to hold one office hour per week. During these times, students from Principle of Economics I can ask questions related to their weekly homework.\\nResearch (4 hrs/week): Each week, student scholars will engage in research activities related to a topic from the coming lesson. The goal is to give the student scholar a deeper understanding of some of the research on a specific topic. For example, in the second week we will discuss capitalism as an economic system. The specific research we may investigate could be based on studies comparing contemporary economic behaviour in the former countries of East and West Germany.\\nWeekly research activities may include, but are not limited to, constructing bibliographies, engaging in online discussion groups, presenting readings, and analyzing data. Online discussion groups will allow student scholars to collaborate on weekly research topics to organize readings and share important findings. Student scholars may be asked to present some of what they have learned during weekly meetings.\\nBy the end of the week of January 14, 2022, student scholars will have to submit either a project proposal or literature review as well as a reflection.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass","categories":["EL"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Modern East Asia","id":"HIS104_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Mark Frank","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NiQAJ/his104fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Mark Frank - E: mark.frank@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: History (HIS), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course covers East Asian History from 1600 to the present with a focus is on the tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, when China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam underwent rapid social and political transformations in response to unprecedented internal and external pressures. Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical \u2018moments\u2019, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion. The course is structured in four major units as follows:\\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region\'s history.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\\n---\\nLectures: All lectures are pre-recorded and online. Two weekly lectures will be posted every Friday night at 22:00 EDT on Canvas. You must watch these lectures BEFORE your weekly team meeting. Each lecture is about an hour long.

It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world? How can global institutions be strengthened to promote international cooperation and effective health policies to prevent future pandemics?\\n---\\n Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, you will be able to:\\nDefine the social, economic and political challenges faced by the global community during the Covid-19 pandemic\\nExplain how international institutions responded to the Covid-19 pandemic\\nIdentify the social, economic and political lessons learned by the global community from the Covid-19 pandemic\\nPropose global policies to address the health and welfare problems posed by future pandemics\\nClearly articulate your ideas in written and oral form\\n---\\nClass Schedule:\\nLearning Materials\\nVideo presentations \u2013 YouTube and other online videos assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeb-based material assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating an issue.\\nReadings \u2013 articles and chapters found online or posted by the instructor as well as material identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeek 1:\\nIntroduction to the Course: Defining the Problem\\nAs a class we will meet to determine a strategy to determine the lessons to be learned from the Covid-19 Pandemic.

The course starts with pre-modern and early modern theorists from East and West like Thucydides, Confucius, Machiavelli, Grotius, Kant, and Hobbes. We go on to explore the development of the first modern International Relations theories at the turn of the 20th century, including Marxism, Classical Liberalism, Classical Realism. We then retrace how Neo-Liberalism and Neo-Realism fought for dominance during the Cold War. Finally, we get to the present era where Critical Theory, Constructivism, Neo-Functionalism, and Intergovernmentalism are now challenging older paradigms and bringing new voices to the International Relations debate. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be introduced to the most influential International Relations theories.\\nStudents will apply their knowledge of the historical, socio-political, and personal context behind the development of International Relations theories to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each school of thought.\\nStudents will apply this knowledge to analyze present-day problems in international relations.\\nStudents will develop critical thinking and argumentative writing skills to synthesize their own philosophy of international relations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule & Readings:\\nRecommended background reading, especially for students unfamiliar with world history: Paul Kennedy, Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\nWeek#: Introduction\\nIntroduction to the course\\nWeek#: Confucius and Mencius in pre-imperial China\\nHow did the political fragmentation of China during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period shape Confucius\u2019 and Mencius\u2019 ideas about inter-state relations?\\nYuri Pines, Foundations of Confucian Thought, Introduction, Chapter 4\\nDavid Kang, \u201cHierarchy and Legitimacy in International Systems: The Tribute System in Early Modern East Asia\u201d; Sungmoon Kim, \u201cMencius on International Relations and the morality of war: From the perspective of Confucian \u2018Moralpolitik\u2019\u201d\\nWeek#: Thucydides in Classical Greece\\nDid Thucydides really believe in \u201cThucydides\u2019 Trap\u201d?\\nGraham Allison, \u201cThe Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?\u201d https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/; James Lee, \u201cDid Thucydides Believe in Thucydides\u2019 Trap?\u201d\\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Chapters I-V, XVII-XVIII, XXIII https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7142/7142-h/7142-h.htm\\nWeek#: Machiavelli in the Italian Renaissance\\nTo what extent was Machiavelli \u201cMachiavellian\u201d?\\nJames Hankins, Virtue Politics: Soulcraft and Statecraft in Renaissance Italy, Chapters I-III\\nNiccol\xf2 Machiavelli, The Prince https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm; Discourses on Livy, Book II http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10827/pg10827-images.html\\nWeek#: Grotius vs. Selden in the Age of Discovery\\nHow did imperial rivalry in the 17th century shape the foundations of the modern Law of the Sea?\\nPeter Borschberg, \u201cThe Seizure of the Sta.

Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\n---\\nCourse Outline: Link\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\n1.

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

It begins by examining what means to represent (literally, re-present) or \u201ctell about\u201d social life, the various ways this has been and can be done, and the challenges we face in doing so in a way that brings value to the social settings and relations within which we work and live. It does so first by examining and comparing various genres of social representation and then distinguishing the social sciences as a distinctive if internally diverse set of approaches to understanding aspects of \\"society\\" or social life. To do this, the course offers a comparative introduction to traditions of social inquiry spanning the fields of sociology, political economy, economics, \\"political science,\\" and anthropology. Finally, the course considers the value and limitations of single-discipline only approaches to understanding the social world and the promise and challenges of a more transdisciplinary approach.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: \\nExplain in generic terms what it means to \u201ctell about\u201d or \u201crepresent\u201d \u201csociety.\u201d\\nDistinguish social sciences from other genres of social representation.\\nMake distinctions among major traditions of inquiry and ideas in the social sciences.\\nGenerate questions and analyze issues from different disciplinary perspectives.\\nBring multiple social scientific and other perspectives on a social issue of interest. \\n---\\nCourse Outline\\n1.

Ethnography refers to both a process of doing ethnography and a written product. In doing ethnography, a researcher actively participates in the group in order to gain an insider\u2019s perspective of the group and to have experiences similar to the group members. In writing ethnography, a researcher narrates observations of the group based on this participation, interviews with group members, and an analysis of group documents and artifacts. This course is designed to provide students with an overview of ethnography and the ethnographic research process, including formulating research questions, finding sources and data, evaluating and critiquing qualitative data including field notes and interview transcripts, and writing an ethnographic report. The course explores crucial aspects of preparing for, realizing and evaluating ethnographic fieldwork.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nAppraise the quality of ethnographic research;\\nAppreciate the role personal and theoretical knowledge play in conducting ethnographic research;\\nComprehend the way ethnographic data is collected and interpreted; and,\\nWrite and present ethnographic research reports.\\n---\\nAssessments:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}]},{"title":"Foundations of Political Economy","id":"SOCI201_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NtQAJ/soci201fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: TBA\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Economics (ECON)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course provides students a rigorous introduction to key ideas, concepts, theories, and problems in classical and contemporary political economy and demonstrates their value for exploring, understanding, and explaining economies and economic aspects of social life in a variety of settings. Drawing on a sociological approach, the course emphasizes political economy\u2019s social foundations and seeks to equip students with the ideas and skills needed to develop an informed analysis of some the most important social, political, economic, and cultural debates of our times. Rather than endorsing any one perspective on economy and society, the course surveys and combines multiple perspectives, drawing from ideas and concepts from various intellectual traditions spanning the fields of economics, sociology, politics, and anthropology. The course explores the strengths and weaknesses of these various traditions. In doing so, the course invites students to appreciate that, whatever our preferred explanatory frame or favored theory may be, no single perspective or intellectual standpoint is likely to be wholly sufficient for understanding or explaining actually existing economies. Rather than dwelling on abstractions, the course addresses real world problems and themes.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain key concepts and theoretical approaches in classical, contemporary political economy.\\nDevelop comparative perspectives on course themes addressed in a variety of settings.\\nCollect and use data to make or explore claims about variety of political economy themes.\\nCompare features of Vietnam\u2019s economy with other countries in the region and the world.\\n---\\nCourse Outline:\\n1.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human. As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.). As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this class, students will be able to:\\nDesign and produce an ethnographic text through writing a mini-ethnography which includes a literature review section\\nApply qualitative anthropological methods to analyze communication and community over new media.\\nUnderstand core concepts in digital anthropology\\nSelect, read, and synthesize secondary sources based on research interests\\nReflect upon their own online experiences and identity formation.\\n---\\nReading Guides\\nReading guides are available to help you work with these texts. They are optional but highly recommended.

A prevailing perception regards Asian women \u2013 especially those highly educated or from powerful families \u2013 as socio-politically as well or even better than their male counterparts. Yet there is little understanding of the history, nature, and challenge of Asian women\u2019s struggle to exercise their political agency. This course offers students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of women and politics in Asia and to explore the significance of gender in politics of the past, present, and future. The course also examines various factors, trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political advancement in contemporary Asia. This course aims to familiarize students with a broad range of issues involving women and politics in Asia \u2013 the political participation of women; the history of women\u2019s movements; political divisions among women; and what we mean when we refer to \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d at home, at work, and in political institutions. Because women\u2019s involvement in the political arena is informed by their roles and status at home and in society at large, the course will also examine sociological, anthropological, and feminist research on such topics as inequality, power, discrimination, and social norms. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning women in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend various institutional, cultural and personal factors, as well as distinctive trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political engagement in Vietnam and Asia;\\nUse basic concepts and theories of women and politics;\\nRead critically the literature and other materials;\\nWrite and present academic research reports; and,\\nReflect upon women in politics and society of Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}]},{"title":"Cultural and Intellectual Foundation of Vietnamese Literary Chinese 1","id":"VS106a_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Phan Thu Van","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NyQAJ/vs106afall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn \\nLevel: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course helps Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Web-based talks and conversations with representative scholars in Vietnamese Studies from North America, Europe, East- and Southeast Asia will help students recognize the global aspects of this fascinating academic field. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. At the end of the course, students are encouraged to work in team on a research topic of their choice with transdisciplinary approaches. This course is open to VSM majors and non-majors.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: After finishing this course, students should be able to \\n- Recognize the importance of Vietnam Studies from a variety of perspectives;\\n- Obtain a general view of Vietnam Studies as it is practiced widely and differently in Vietnam as well in the rest of the world, thus get ready for their graduate studies;\\n- Get connected with leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\\n- How to contextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\\n- How to identify a substantial and meaningful Vietnam-based research topic that can trigger international interests;\\n- Locate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam; \\n- Apply transdisciplinary approaches to their research.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\n(re)sources survey (20%)\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Digital Creative Writing: Lessons from Vietnamese and Non-Vietnamese Writers","id":"VS207_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"\u0110\xe0o L\xea Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NxQAJ/vs207fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory- Arts & Humanities (C1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: Currently, creative writing is widely applied in many fields. Additionally, creative writing is also an essential subject for those who want to become professional writers as well as share their works through digital platforms. This course accumulates several skills, including reading and analyzing literary works, observations, research, along with in-depth interviews. The core of the course is to help students discover the digital world and how to compose digital texts. Students will be encouraged to think out of the box, explore their favorite creative writing styles, and choose a suitable form for their works and other ones of interactive storytelling in new media. Furthermore, contemporary social issues, historical and cultural issues of Vietnam in the context of globalization are going to be taken as the main themes of students\u2019 works. The course will be joined by both national and international experts, famous writers, such as: Ocean Vuong, Nguyen Thanh Viet, Monique Truong, Suzanne Joinson, Tran Thuy Mai and so on to share their experiences through online platform. Students will combine theoretical knowledge, including reading, analysing literary works, with practical observation gained from a field trip to find their creative materials.

Originated from Buddhism but now practiced out of their Buddhist philosophical/ontological contexts, they seem to establish certain living styles habitually described as \u201cpositive,\u201d or \u201cconscious,\u201d but at the same time, are running the risk of going against what the Buddha taught. Thus, to better understand those concepts and put them back into practice more effectively, one cannot but return to their root which is Buddhism. Buddhist ethics (\u201cethics\u201d here can be simply defined as a system of moral principles) undoubtedly plays a crucial role in Vietnamese moral life.\\nIn Vietnam as well as elsewhere, one of the causes that create generation gaps between parents and children is the fact that they are living with/practicing not the same ethical values. A common ethical ground must be first founded to bridge the gaps, to ensure mutual understanding between the individual and her/his ever-expanded communal networks, starting with the family (as the core of society), to community (such as hamlet or village), nation, and finally to the world (natural world included). With the whole-person education framework, the Fulbright University Viet Nam aims to develop its graduates not only as young promising professionals in their fields, but also as moral citizens who can significantly contribute to society in contemporary Vietnamese and global contexts. Such a goal surely cannot be achieved in the absence of moral principles (or ethics).\\nThrough reading assignments, guest lectures given by Vietnamese and international scholars as well as religious practitioners, and field study trips, students of this course will be exposed to various Buddhist traditions performed in Vietnam, East- and Southeast Asian regions. Films, literature, and newspapers will serve as the main sources for case studies and reference. Service learning is also required as an integral part of the course.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nAfter finishing the course, students should be able to:\\n* Acquire a general understanding of Buddhism and its key concepts, moral values, practices, and movements in various regional settings of East- and Southeast Asia, with a focus on Vietnam.\\n* Identify similarities and differences between Western concepts of \u201cethics\u201d and particular aspects of Buddhist ethics.\\n* Recognize Buddhist ethical values practiced in Vietnam and neighboring countries, and refer to Buddhist moral principles as a reference in their daily life.\\n* Explain the rise, popularity, and importance of certain social practices deeply rooted in Buddhism (such as \u201cMindfulness\u201d or \u201cLoving kindness\u201d) around the world, particularly in contemporary Vietnam.\\n* Appreciate Buddhist ethics as an effective way for self-cultivation to become a whole person, a good citizen, and a responsible professional.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\nService-learning (20%) \u2013 to be discussed with students\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["Core","E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]}]')},140:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"title":"Introduction to Photography History and Theory","id":"ARTS103_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"TBA","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OPQAZ/arts103spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: TBA\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: ARTS101 Introduction to Visual Studies\\nFormat: On-campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: We live today in a world of photographic images. Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded.

We will explore the theoretical concepts of movement and apply them through practice to build students\u2019 foundations in movement, and learn how to develop a sense of rhythm, timing, rhythmical expression, and musicality as key to the creative process of dance. Health and safety components are essential in the development of a performer, therefore, students will obtain fundamental knowledge of the mechanics of the body. This course will also offer an opportunity to explore the intricate process and progress of a performance. Students will learn about the different elements of a production, including routine development, staging, formations, and presentation, and critically examine and analyze movement and dance from different styles of commercial dance.

We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art.

Rather than study Vietnamese art in a linear chronological fashion, we will examine Vietnamese modern and contemporary art and visual culture through a thematic lens. The course will be organized through topical units - such as architecture, fashion, socialism, memorials, diaspora, and ecology - that are intended to introduce broader concepts and relevant methods of field research that have resonance within and outside Vietnam. These concepts will be animated and contextualized through film screenings, field trips to cultural sites, and studio visits with artists. Through such on-site encounters, students will be encouraged to explore alternative methods of research and to better understand the idea of art as a lived experience.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few. At the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world\'s leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the \'nuts and bolts\' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1.

Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely apprecicate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies.

This course is designed particularly to engage students in conversations around human development in the context of Vietnam and Vietnamese culture in order to start to compare and contrast it with the contemporary understandings and research of various developmental psychology theories and topics\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nAfter finishing this course, students should be able to:\\n1. Explain the physical/biological, cognitive, cultural, environmental, and social-emotional factors that influence human development throughout the lifespan.\\n2. Distinguish myths and misconceptions from research evidence regarding human development throughout the lifespan.\\n3. Apply developmental psychology principles to daily life throughout the lifespan\\n4. Describe research methodological approaches used to study human development across the lifespan.\\n5. Assess and critically analyze theories, research and applications developed by developmental psychologists and effectively communicate the analysis to the community","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Spring Seminar","id":"SEM302_Spring2022_S01","credits":"2","instructor":"Fulbright faculty and potentially some visiting faculty","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Ju39fQAB/sem302spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Fulbright faculty and potentially some visiting faculty\\nCategory: Seminar\\nCredits: 02 credits\\nPre-requisite: For 3rd year students. Non-compulsory but strongly recommended\\nFormat: On-campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: The Fulbright Seminar Series draws upon the university\u2019s most valuable resource - the creative inspiration of its faculty - to upgrade our students\u2019 toolboxes with an awareness of research methodology from many areas of study, and the ability to formulate research questions, review existing research, and produce a coherent proposal for an original research project. By showcasing our faculty\u2019s cutting-edge research, the Fulbright Seminar Series hopes to inspire our students to begin their own journeys as original contributors to their chosen fields. \\nThere will be a wide range of topics, varied by different seminars. For example, the faculty in charge will prepare a list of questions/topics and have them introduced to students in the first session. Students will choose a suggested topic or their own tentative Capstone topic of interest to prepare a research proposal. While students are expected to work on their proposal independently, teamwork is also possible (need to be approved case-by-case).\\nThe sessions will feature presentations by one or more faculty members across different fields of study, highlighting or contrasting their pursuits and significance.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe Student Research Workshops aim to develop students\u2019 independent research skills to prepare for the Capstone, write a proposal for their Capstone project as well as future research projects. Upon completion of this seminar, students will gain significant improvement on the abilities to:\\n\u2022 pose well-defined research questions.\\n\u2022 locate research topics and find relevant literature.\\n\u2022 develop appropriate methodologies to address the research questions.\\n\u2022 write up a research proposal.\\n\u2022 present ideas and research plans.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nThe seminar structure will be flexible and be at the discretion of the faculty running the sessions. One example of the spring seminar structure might include two parts:\\nPart 1 (6 meetings): In this part students focus on finding resources and conducting literature review. In the first two meetings, faculty present their own experience on how to approach a research topic, where and how to find resources, how to conduct and write up a thorough literature review (given a research question/topic). In the next four meetings, students take turns to present their findings on their topics and receive feedback. Outcome of this part is a complete literature review\\nPart 2 (6 meetings): Sample research proposals will be carefully analyzed by faculty in the first two meetings: how to pose a research question, how to write an introduction, how to choose a methodology, and how to make plans. The next two meetings will be organized as Q&A sessions. Students take turns to talk about their methodologies and receive feedback/suggestions from faculty.\\nIn the last two meetings, students present their research proposals as a practice defense. Outcome of this part is a complete research proposal.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass. Students are graded on their written proposal and their participation in the seminar by the faculty in charge.","categories":["Seminar"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Research Methods & Statistics","id":"SOCI105_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Kinho Chan","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3ONQAZ/soci105spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Kinho Chan \u2013 E: kinho.chan@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: CORE103 Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age OR CORE104 Scientific Inquiry\\nCourse Format: On-campus\\nCross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Psychology (PSY)\\nNote: This course was known as \\"Research Methods in Social & Behavioral Science (Co-design)\\" course (former title)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course is designed to help students learn to make systematic observations, derive scientific questions, form hypotheses, carry out research, analyze data, interpret results, and report findings.

Rooted in geography, intellectual traditions and history, these ideas are vital to moulding regionally distinctive identities, biographies, and patterns of change. This course examines conceptions of power and selfhood in mainland Southeast Asia. The investigation moves from remote mountain valleys to bustling coastal ports, and from the village to the palace, tracing the foundations of royal power, political community, conflict, resistance, and belonging. The course explores what it means to be a person in Southeast Asia, and how people are ritually incorporated into bodies, families, social statuses, networks, and nations. Most examples in the course are drawn from the \'Indianized\' societies of Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, however, case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia feature, as do those drawn from Vietnam and Southern China. Course participants will gain insights into the socio-cultural dynamics of Vietnam\'s close neighbours and the comparative study of societies and cultures. They will become familiar with crucial concepts such as \u2018galactic polity\u2019, \u2018theatre state\u2019, \u2018mandala\u2019, \u2018muang\u2019, \u2018Zomia\u2019, \u2018entourage\u2019, and \'entrepot, and understand the significance of initiation ceremonies, ordination, warfare, bilateral kinship, and gender complementarity. Students will learn how anthropologists, historians and political scientists have developed knowledge of Southeast Asian cultures, utilizing knowledge of local languages, textual study, in-depth observations, surveys, and long-term field research.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \\"do things\\". Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity. Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d? or an insult? Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human. This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics. These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.\\n Please note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Augustus in Saigon?

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. The aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. Building on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a mobile app that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This app also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century..

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \\nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Documentary Films from Vietnam: History, Theory, and Practice","id":"VS108_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Dao Le Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OaQAJ/vs108spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: On-campus\\nCross-listed: Vietnamese Studies (VS), Arts (ARTS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: Documentary film has always had a certain appeal to the audience because it manifests the filmmakers\u2019 observation and point of view on real life. \u2018Reality\u2019, as Patricia Aufderheide mentioned in his book Documentary Film: a Very Short Introduction \u201cis not what is out there but what we know, understand, and share with each other of what is out there (\u2026) Documentary is an important reality-shaping communication, because of its claims to truth.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n ---\\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:  \\nMaker Space Training: 20%\\nTheory: 40%\\nApplication: 40%","categories":["Core"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Security & Cryptography","id":"CS305_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Murphy Rallapalli","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002HzUOSQA3/cs305summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Murphy Rallapalli\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: CS101 \u2013 Computer Science 1,\\nFormat: On-campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: Society is increasingly reliant on computing systems for storing various kinds of information including a lot of sensitive information, such as financial data, health records, and classified business documents.

Drawing from fiction, film, memoir, news articles, poems, cartoons, and historical and feminist works, we will analyze women\u2019s contributions to warfare in the following roles: as mothers, nurses, wives, resistance fighters, base workers, sex workers, war brides, anti-war protestors, journalists, humanitarians, soldiers, and political leaders. Students taking this course will gain a deeper appreciation of Vietnamese and U.S. women\u2019s history and the issues surrounding women\u2019s portrayals as nurturers, breeders, protected others, betrayers, victims, consumers, sexual provocateurs, and woman warriors.Through class discussions, presentations, and writing assignments, students will develop skills to critically interpret women\u2019s real and fantasized relationships to modern wars. Students will also develop a vocabulary in gender and feminist studies through the applied use of terms and concepts like gender construction, differences between gender and sex, gender performance, gender non-conformity, intersectionality, interpellations between societal gender and war structures, and the mobilization of gendered identities for militarized purposes in the U.S. and Vietnam during the Vietnam War Er.

Can we measure how likely an event could happen? Weather turns bad or good, Stock market rises or falls, Trump gets elected or not..., these are the events that no one can be certain of. Probability and statistics is a mathematical theory that can help us understand about the randomness of events and use the data from the past to predict the future. In this course we will explore the nature of random events and build up the mathematical models and tools that can be used to calculate the chance of event happening. With a strong foundation we will also consider many real world problems on how to handle and understand data and make meaningful statistical inference. The applications come from many areas such as industrial quality control , market share prediction and even a little bit of Las Vegas gambling.

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected. An important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node. The theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context. One of the innovations of this course is related to coupling the idea of sustainability with Bionic Theory (a.k.a. Biomimicry) used in urban design, architecture and structures. In the Bionic approach the students will select a preferred natural process and investigate the system and the inner rules of the natural elements. They will understand how the nature works, analyzing the mathematical and physical process of the nature. Finally they will realize physical models to express how the natural systems work. During the Bionic Design phase, the students will use the results of the investigation produced in the first phase and finally they will produce a project of sustainable urban Eco-District, Eco-Village or architecture. The logic is to direct the students in the use of the bionic process in the design in order to create sustainable systems.","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Development from Below: Indigenous paths to modernity in Vietnam","id":"SOCI207_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Philip Taylor","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OmQAJ/soci207summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Philip Taylor\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nCourse Format: On-campus\\nCross-listed: Social Science (SOCI), Economics (ECON), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: Development in Vietnam is a grand yet unfinished project: many ethnic minorities and upland communities remain poor; people in remote localities and marginal social positions risk being left behind. Such bleak outcomes are sometimes attributed to the \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 customs, beliefs and habits of people who adhere to traditional lifeways, religious values, or ethnic preferences that are seen as obstacles to change. This critique has inspired efforts to simplify or eliminate diverse local traditions and practices, on the grounds that they pose barriers to development and human improvement. Yet such efforts have, in turn, led target groups to resist development, for instance by clinging with renewed vigour to the past, or to claims of innate difference, or holding out hope for miraculous salvation. The sheer diversity of indigenous cultures in Vietnam is a thorny challenge for a country that is serious about the objective of inclusive development. \\nThis course takes a different tack in examining diversity as a potential resource for development. Critical of top-down development, which often proceeds in ignorance of what works locally, it explores the myriad ways that ordinary Vietnamese people have contributed, in their own manner, to development in their country. In numerous localities, people have achieved a measure of economic growth, intellectual development, material security, social cohesion, and inclusion by drawing on non-conventional resources such as spiritual capital, ethnic networks, traditional kinship, indigenous gender ideologies, communal bonds, myth, local memory, or religious morality. In so doing they neither resist change, nor abandon their traditions, but instead mobilize time-honoured capacities and logics to chart an indigenous path to development. The course reviews a selection of influential development theories and introduces fascinating case studies drawn from a variety of localities in Vietnam that were generated with ethnographic methods. The case studies open eyes to the multitude of development challenges Vietnam faces but also the rich fund of indigenous experiences and capacities currently being activated by ordinary people in numerous places to solve their diverse problems as examples of \u2018development from below\u2019.
