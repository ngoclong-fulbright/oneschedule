Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape. \\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration.

As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance.

To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. Students will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization.

What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be \'the Asian century\', the term \u2018Post-Asia\u2019 thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the \u2018East vs West\u2019 binary.

It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world? How can global institutions be strengthened to promote international cooperation and effective health policies to prevent future pandemics? \\n Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, you will be able to\\n1.Define the social, economic and political challenges faced by the global community during the Covid-19 pandemic\\n2.Explain how international institutions responded to the Covid-19 pandemic\\n3.Identify the social, economic and political lessons learned by the global community from the Covid-19 pandemic\\n4.Propose global policies to address the health and welfare problems posed by future pandemics\\n5.Clearly articulate your ideas in written and oral form","notes":"Visiting Faculty: Geoffrey Stewart\\nLevel: Intermediate\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\n","schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"6:30 PM","end_time":"8:00 PM"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"6:30 PM","end_time":"8:00 PM"}]},{"id":"SOCI208_Fall2021_S01","title":"Culture and the Economy in Developing Asia","credits":4,"instructor":"Philip Taylor","description":"Careful observation and reasoning have enabled social scientists to formulate principles of universal applicability to economic activities and outcomes. However, the economy is also embedded in a great variety of human cultures and circumstances. Religious values powerfully shape economic choices; habits and customs guide economic decision-making; circumstances and status constrain action and outcomes. Observable variety in economic forms and fortunes in the modern world reflect diversity in the values that people have brought to their economic endeavours, as well as in the capacities and strategies that they as economic actors have used to realise their desires. In other words, the economy is entwined in life, culture, and society, and must be studied in such contexts. This course introduces classic social science theories that explore the relationship between culture and the economy. Focussing on the market economy in modern Asia, it examines the cultural dispositions that have encouraged, retarded, and reshaped the development of capitalist market relations in this region. With case studies drawn from a range of countries and cultural milieux, it examines how the transition to the market has been enabled and experienced. As a user\'s guide to the market economy in Asia it uncovers the variety of ways that local actors have maintained, adapted and instrumentalised culture to make a living. It examines economic complexity: how local values shape the economy; how people limit the impact of the market in their lives; and how they conceptualise, cope with and challenge marketisation. It offers a guide to the lived economy in Asia, in all its splendid variety and ingenuity.\\nLearning Objectives: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\n\u2022\\tExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\n\u2022\\tUnderstand and describe the connections between culture and the economy.\\n\u2022\\tApply the theories and concepts learned in class to critically assess the relationship between culture and the economy in Asia.\\n\u2022\\tUse the comparative method to contextualise and explain regional variations in economic practice and outcomes. \\n\u2022\\tCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\n\u2022\\tApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze the nexus between culture and the economy in Vietnam. \\n\u2022\\tDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n\u2022\\tCommunicate course concepts clearly, coherently, and with adequate use of evidence in spoken and written forms.","notes":"Visiting Faculty: Philip Taylor \\nLevel: Intermediate\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-campus\\nCross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Economics (ECON), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n","schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"9:45 AM","end_time":"11:15 AM"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"9:45 AM","end_time":"11:15 AM"}]},{"id":"CS301_Fall2021_S01","title":"Software Engineering","credits":4,"instructor":"Nguyen V.

This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\\n- Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\n- Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\n- Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\\n- Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\\n- Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.","notes":"Faculty: Core teaching team\\nLevel: Core\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-campus\\n","schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"9:45 AM","end_time":"11:15 AM"}]},{"id":"CORE103_Fall2021_S02","title":"Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (B)","credits":4,"instructor":"Core Teaching Team","description":"Digital technology transforms the way we live: from how we travel, to what we use for money, to how we swipe to find love.

This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisiting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.","notes":"Faculty: Truong Trung Kien - E: kien.truong@fulbright.edu.vn\\n        Level: Intermediate\\n        \\n        Credits: 04 credits\\n        \\n        Pre-requisite: CS 101 \u2013 Computer Science 1, or equivalent programming experience\\n        \\n        Format: Online\\n        \\n        Cross-listed: Computer Science (CS), Engineering (ENG)","schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"3:00 PM","end_time":"4:30 PM"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"3:00 PM","end_time":"4:30 PM"}]},{"id":"CORE101_Fall2021_S04","title":"Global Humanities and Social Change (C)","credits":4,"instructor":"Core Teaching Team","description":"This course examines key moments in the global history of thought through the lens of textual analysis.

Thus, to better understand those concepts and put them back into practice more effectively, one cannot but return to their root which is Buddhism. Buddhist ethics (\u201cethics\u201d here can be simply defined as a system of moral principles) undoubtedly plays a crucial role in Vietnamese moral life.\\n        In Vietnam as well as elsewhere, one of the causes that create generation gaps between parents and children is the fact that they are living with/practicing not the same ethical values. A common ethical ground must be first founded to bridge the gaps, to ensure mutual understanding between the individual and her/his ever-expanded communal networks, starting with the family (as the core of society), to community (such as hamlet or village), nation, and finally to the world (natural world included). With the whole-person education framework, the Fulbright University Viet Nam aims to develop its graduates not only as young promising professionals in their fields, but also as moral citizens who can significantly contribute to society in contemporary Vietnamese and global contexts. Such a goal surely cannot be achieved in the absence of moral principles (or ethics).\\n        \\n        Through reading assignments, guest lectures given by Vietnamese and international scholars as well as religious practitioners, and field study trips, students of this course will be exposed to various Buddhist traditions performed in Vietnam, East- and Southeast Asian regions.
