Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.",

In addition, we will study selected topics in the history of dance, both in its local and international aspects, and the impact of dance within Vietnam and beyond in the 21st century. We will explore the theoretical concepts of movement and apply them through practice to build students\u2019 foundations in movement, and learn how to develop a sense of rhythm, timing, rhythmical expression, and musicality as key to the creative process of dance. Health and safety components are essential in the development of a performer, therefore, students will obtain fundamental knowledge of the mechanics of the body. This course will also offer an opportunity to explore the intricate process and progress of a performance. Students will learn about the different elements of a production, including routine development, staging, formations, and presentation, and critically examine and analyze movement and dance from different styles of commercial dance. Throughout the course, students will work on incremental activities in preparation for a final production and execution of a performance.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nAnalyze the basic components of a dance performance/routine\nDevelop fundamental skills in movement [e.g., technique, execution, coordination]\nDemonstrate the key elements of dance [e.g., rhythm, musicality]\nAcquire the necessary practical knowledge and skills to create and showcase a dance performance\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nAttendance and participation: 15%\nCritical analysis of a dance performance: 5%\nMid-term small group creativity presentation: 15%\nFinal individual dance development evaluation: 30%\nFinal group performance production: 35%",

This course is designed to help students understand basic narrative concepts and to develop storytelling strategies through a variety of moving image formats, including mainstream films and television, documentary films, video art, music videos, advertising, and propaganda. We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art. Students' engagement with these topics will be brought to bear on the final project, either a scripted or video re-working of a film/video work.",

Rather than study Vietnamese art in a linear chronological fashion, we will examine Vietnamese modern and contemporary art and visual culture through a thematic lens. The course will be organized through topical units - such as architecture, fashion, socialism, memorials, diaspora, and ecology - that are intended to introduce broader concepts and relevant methods of field research that have resonance within and outside Vietnam. These concepts will be animated and contextualized through film screenings, field trips to cultural sites, and studio visits with artists. Through such on-site encounters, students will be encouraged to explore alternative methods of research and to better understand the idea of art as a lived experience.

Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero. All late take-home assignments are subject to a 3% penalty every 24 hours.

How do we write programs that work correctly and can be refactored and improved over time? This course continues and expands on content from Computer Science I, with a greater focus on theoretical concepts, abstraction, and larger programs. Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing and refactoring, basic algorithm analysis, searching and sorting, linear data structures (lists, maps, stacks, and queues), trees, and graphs.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nBy the end of this course, you will know and understand the essential abstractions that allow humans to harness computation to build complex software systems and solve difficult real-world problems. You will develop your ability to break a problem down into subproblems, to develop modular solutions, and to leverage existing software libraries. You will also see how abstract data types are implemented using various data structures (and even implement some yourself). Understanding what is \u201cunder the hood\u201d is valuable not only because it informs later use, but also because you will see how certain design decisions have profound implications on performance and usability. Finally, by taking this course, you will develop your proficiency with the Java language and improve your programming methodology, and thus become a more effective software developer.\n---\nCourse Materials:\nBuilding Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach (5th Edition) by Reges and Stepp. Earlier editions are also acceptable",

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Shuyin Tang\nCategory: Exploratory- Social Sciences (C2)\nCredits: 02 credits\nPre-requisite: Students should have completed all of their core courses.\nFormat: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: Venture capital investing is all the rage in Vietnam right now. A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few. At the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world's leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the 'nuts and bolts' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, students should be able to: \nUnderstand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit\nApply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors' as well as the entrepreneurs' point of view\nArticulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums\nExplain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly\n---\nDetailed Sessions Guide\nTopic: The entrepreneurial journey \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cThe Entrepreneurial Journey\u201d, Stuart Crainer, London Business School  \n\u201cThe Questions Every Entrepreneur Must Answer\u201d, Amar Bidhe, Harvard Business Review, 1996 \nTopic: Structure of the VC industry: Who\u2019s who and how do VCs make money? \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cA Day in the Life of a Venture Capitalist\u201d (Stanford Case E-44, January 28, 2013) \n\u201c16 Definitions on the Economics of VC\u201d, Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz \n\u201cSix Myths About Venture Capitalists\u201d, Diane Mulcahy, HBS \nChapter 1 \u201cThe Players\u201d and Chapter 10 \u201cHow Venture Capital Funds Work\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson \nTopic: Developing a fund investment thesis \nRequired Readings:\nChapter 6 \u201cDefining Your Fund\u2019s Investment Strategy\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani \nDoes your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?, David Teten and Stephane Nasser, TechCrunch120 \nCompilation of VC Investment Theses, Alexander Jarvis \nA Short Guide to Impact Investing, The Case Foundation \nTopic: Deal sourcing and initial selection \nRequired Readings:\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned About Deal Sourcing, Danielle Morrill \nHow VCs Source Deals, Allen Latta  \nIn Defence of the Deck, Bill Gurley  \nChapter 15 \u201cSourcing Investment Opportunities\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \nTopic: Due diligence \nRequired Readings:\nChapter 16 \u201cThe Art of Conducting Due Diligence\u201d and Chapter 17 \u201cManagement Team Diligence\u201d and Chapter 18 \u201cDiligence beyond Management\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \nImpact Due Diligence: Emerging Best Practices, Pacific Community Ventures \nTopic: Cap tables and Valuation \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cFinancing New Ventures\u201d (HBS Note N9-811-093, March 28, 2011)  \n\u201cNote on Valuation in Private Company Settings (HBS #9-297-050, April 2002)  \nChapter 7 \u201cThe Capitalization Table\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \nTopic: Term Sheets and Legal  \nRequired Readings:\nChapters 3 - 6, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \nVenture Capital Lexicon, Series A Term Sheet, Singapore Venture Capital ASsociation (SVCA)  \n\u201cVenture Capital Negotiations: VC versus the Entrepreneur\u201d (HBS # 9-800-170, March 2, 2000) \nTopic: What happens after the deal is closed: portfolio management through to exit \nRequired Readings:\nHow to Build a Great Startup Board: Part I and II, Reid Hoffman  \n\u201cThe Secret to Making Board Meetings Suck Less\u201d  \nMeasuring and Managing Impact: A Practical Guide, EVPA  \n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nClass contribution and Attendance: 20%\nReflections on in-class dialogues/simulations: 30%\nFinal Assessment (in a form of a mini-investment memorandum): 50%",

The recent economic history and political economy of selected Sub-Saharan African countries will be compared with development experience in Southeast Asia, but the important differences between individual African economies will be emphasised and there will be a focus on the performance of specific African sectors, sub-sectors and on the granular detail of economic policy issues.\nStudents will be asked to assess academic publications by development economists, focussing on the theoretical work underpinning most current policy advice and the interventions of international agencies as well as African states. They will be encouraged to develop the self-confidence to criticize this literature, to recognise the range of ideological prejudice it can disguise and to appreciate the weakness of the data used by many economists. Some of the course content and a very large bibliography is available to students by downloading my book on African Economic Development from the website of Oxford University Press (open access).\nThe issues covered will include: Famine, Food Insecurity and Undernutrition; Demographic Change; Gender Relations; Trends in the Terms of Trade and in the Share of World Markets; Trends in Public Sector Investment, in Official Development Assistance Flows and in Foreign Direct Investment; The Quality of Survey data on Poverty, Labour Markets, Households and Farms; Prospects for a Green Revolution; Agricultural Extension, Entrepreneurial Training and Microcredit; Agribusiness, Processing and the Manufacturing Sector. At the end of the course and after discussing each of the above issues, students will be encouraged to draw policy conclusions and to make concrete suggestions for improving policymaking in a specific country.",

In this course, we will learn and practice some of the most common approaches in developing mathematical models of such systems and then implement the models in Python to simulate the systems computationally to make it possible to investigate their behaviors and quantitative performance in well-designed scenarios. The students are encouraged to work in groups on term-projects of which the topics may be a mechanical system, a natural process or a disease's transmission in a certain area.",

Students will study the roots of historical thinking in Europe and Asia, read and critique the field\u2019s foundational texts, challenge their assumptions about objectivity, and debate the best ways to explore the past. Using Ho Chi Minh City as their laboratory, students will try out the historian\u2019s toolkit and use different methodological approaches to explore history in local, regional, and global contexts. Throughout the course, students will analyze a wealth of primary sources, visit a local archive, conduct oral interviews, experiment with digital history, and design their own research project. This year, Fulbright History Lab will collaborate with Princeton University's History Dialogues Project to provide students an introduction to oral history methods, research ethics, and project design. As part of this semester-long module, students will have the opportunity to interact with students from Princeton's partner institutions around the world.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\n5. Propose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\n6. Critically analyze and interpret primary sources\n7. Clearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nSynchronous online discussion participation 10% \nAsynchronous online discussion forums 10% \nLearning Activities 20% \nAssignment 1 20% \nAssignment 2 25% \nAssignment 3 15%",

Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated.

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely apprecicate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies. We hope by the end, students will treasure the beauty of light and explore it as a sustainable solution for our common home, the Earth. ",

What properties make copper a great material for electronics and statues? Each material has its story full of ups and downs that involves not only science but also culture and economics. Their distinctive properties influence their usage in manufacturing and arts. How might these stories connect to you? What would be a perfect material in your opinion? We will explore questions like these, do some experiments, and have you look at the materials that make up your own living environment. We will also talk about pigments, which is a bit nontraditional for a material course, but I love them. And what is a world without colors, right?",

This is an introductory course and our focus will thus be broad. We will cover a wide range of texts from antiquity to the present day, from Ancient Greece to Jacobean England, Victorian England, French Indochina and the contemporary U.S. In doing so our aim will be to understand texts intertextually \u2013 to become alive to the ways that poems and prose draw on, and break from, longstanding literary traditions. We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it. We will read with the understanding that all of these ways of reading are mutually inclusive. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon course completion, students: \n\u2022 Will be able to explain the historical significance of several major literary traditions and their interrelations \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate the formal qualities of poetry, prose, and drama \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate key problems in texts\u2019 representations of individualism and civic responsibility \n\u2022 Will be able to engage in constructive peer review (as both reviewer and reviewee) in order to create effective and sound written and spoken analytical texts",

Non-compulsory but strongly recommended\nFormat: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: The Fulbright Seminar Series draws upon the university\u2019s most valuable resource - the creative inspiration of its faculty - to upgrade our students\u2019 toolboxes with an awareness of research methodology from many areas of study, and the ability to formulate research questions, review existing research, and produce a coherent proposal for an original research project. By showcasing our faculty\u2019s cutting-edge research, the Fulbright Seminar Series hopes to inspire our students to begin their own journeys as original contributors to their chosen fields. \nThere will be a wide range of topics, varied by different seminars. For example, the faculty in charge will prepare a list of questions/topics and have them introduced to students in the first session. Students will choose a suggested topic or their own tentative Capstone topic of interest to prepare a research proposal. While students are expected to work on their proposal independently, teamwork is also possible (need to be approved case-by-case).\nThe sessions will feature presentations by one or more faculty members across different fields of study, highlighting or contrasting their pursuits and significance.\n---\nLearning Objectives: \nThe Student Research Workshops aim to develop students\u2019 independent research skills to prepare for the Capstone, write a proposal for their Capstone project as well as future research projects. Upon completion of this seminar, students will gain significant improvement on the abilities to:\n\u2022 pose well-defined research questions.\n\u2022 locate research topics and find relevant literature.\n\u2022 develop appropriate methodologies to address the research questions.\n\u2022 write up a research proposal.\n\u2022 present ideas and research plans.\n---\nCourse Outline\nThe seminar structure will be flexible and be at the discretion of the faculty running the sessions. One example of the spring seminar structure might include two parts:\nPart 1 (6 meetings): In this part students focus on finding resources and conducting literature review. In the first two meetings, faculty present their own experience on how to approach a research topic, where and how to find resources, how to conduct and write up a thorough literature review (given a research question/topic). In the next four meetings, students take turns to present their findings on their topics and receive feedback. Outcome of this part is a complete literature review\nPart 2 (6 meetings): Sample research proposals will be carefully analyzed by faculty in the first two meetings: how to pose a research question, how to write an introduction, how to choose a methodology, and how to make plans. The next two meetings will be organized as Q&A sessions. Students take turns to talk about their methodologies and receive feedback/suggestions from faculty.\nIn the last two meetings, students present their research proposals as a practice defense. Outcome of this part is a complete research proposal.\n---\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass. Students are graded on their written proposal and their participation in the seminar by the faculty in charge.",

Rooted in geography, intellectual traditions and history, these ideas are vital to moulding regionally distinctive identities, biographies, and patterns of change. This course examines conceptions of power and selfhood in mainland Southeast Asia. The investigation moves from remote mountain valleys to bustling coastal ports, and from the village to the palace, tracing the foundations of royal power, political community, conflict, resistance, and belonging. The course explores what it means to be a person in Southeast Asia, and how people are ritually incorporated into bodies, families, social statuses, networks, and nations. Most examples in the course are drawn from the 'Indianized' societies of Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, however, case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia feature, as do those drawn from Vietnam and Southern China. Course participants will gain insights into the socio-cultural dynamics of Vietnam's close neighbours and the comparative study of societies and cultures. They will become familiar with crucial concepts such as \u2018galactic polity\u2019, \u2018theatre state\u2019, \u2018mandala\u2019, \u2018muang\u2019, \u2018Zomia\u2019, \u2018entourage\u2019, and 'entrepot, and understand the significance of initiation ceremonies, ordination, warfare, bilateral kinship, and gender complementarity. Students will learn how anthropologists, historians and political scientists have developed knowledge of Southeast Asian cultures, utilizing knowledge of local languages, textual study, in-depth observations, surveys, and long-term field research.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.  ",

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \"do things\". Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity. Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d? or an insult? Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human. This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics. These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.\n Please note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.",

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. The aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. Building on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a mobile app that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This app also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century..  ",

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \n---\nCourse Readings:\nThere is no textbook for this course.

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn \nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nCourse Format: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: Vietnamese Literary Chinese is an important part of the formation of Vietnamese culture and ideology. Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.",

Documentaries are always grounded in real life, and make a claim to tell us something worth knowing about it.\u201d Therefore, social issues of national identity, collective memory, gender, the diaspora will be effectively communicated to the audience through the visual expression of documentary storytelling.\nThis course is directed to students who like watching documentaries and hope to make documentaries. The teaching team including Vietnamese documentary researchers and filmmakers will help students to focus on analyzing selected documentaries and practical filmmaking training. Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing. One of the course\u2019s features is that its students will make a documentary film based on Vietnamese cultural and social materials exposed to them during the course. At the end of the course, students will submit a documentary film in which academic knowledge can be utilized and integrated.",
