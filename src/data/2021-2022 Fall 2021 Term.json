    "description": "Faculty: Pamela Corey - E: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\nPre-requisite: This course serves as a prerequisite for most intermediate and advanced Art and Media Studies courses.\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nCourse Format: Online\n---\nCourse Description: Images function as both a practical artistic medium (in advertisements for example) but also as something to be aesthetically enjoyed. They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\nSample Topic Schedule\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\n1. The Power of Images: Why study the visual?\n2. Signification and Value\n3. Vision/Perspective/Realism\n4. Technologies of Vision and Reproduction\n5. Visual Essay Presentations\nSPACES OF VISION/ENVISIONING SPACE\n6. Spaces of Identity: The Social Construction of the Self\n7. Surveillance, Spectacle, and Resistance\n8. Spaces of Identity: Colonialism and Nationalism\n9. Institutional Spaces: Collection and Exhibition\nGLOBAL VISUAL CULTURES\n10. Spaces of Identity: Postcolonialism and Diaspora\n11. Media and Mass Culture\n12. Digital Visualities and Virtual Bodies\n13. Contemporary Globalization\n14. Paper consultations\n\nAssessments and Grading:\nPARTICIPATION (Attendance, online engagement in required forums and discussions, in-class participation in discussions, feedback sessions, informal presentations, etc.): 15%\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION - Visual Essay Group Project: 25%\nSPACES OF VISION/ENVISIONING SPACE - Spatial Analysis Essay (1000-1250 words): 25%\nGLOBAL VISUAL CULTURES - Research Project (2000-2250 words): 35%",

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nDemonstrate a basic understanding of the video making process.\nDevelop comprehension of non-linear editing concepts and practical competency in the usage of non-linear video-editing software. \nDevelop skills in basic script writing format and an understanding of filmic narrative structure.\nDemonstrate competency in oral presentation and studio critique.\nAcquire introductory knowledge of seminal video artworks and experimental films.\nAssessments & Grading:\nAttendance and Participation:15%\nVideo Project, Individual: One video with duration of less than 5-minutes made using only found footage. 30%\nPresentation and critique session for 5-minute video. 10%\nFinal video project, Individual: One final video with duration of less than 10 minutes, using footage shot by the student. 35%\nPresentation and critique session for 10-minute video final project. 10%",

This course is not recommended for first-year students and student enrollment may be subject to instructor approval. Recommended but not required: ARTS102 Introduction to Art History and Theory\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nFormat: Online\n---\nCourse Description: This course surveys the works of Asian artists practicing in Asia and beyond from 1960 to the present, working in mediums that include painting, installation, moving image, performance, and their crossovers. Instead of geographically mapping these practices and artists by nation or region, we will examine selected case studies and specific artworks through such thematic and conceptual topics as the Body, Painting, Technology, Archive, Scale, and Voice. What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be 'the Asian century', the term \u2018Post-Asia\u2019 thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the \u2018East vs West\u2019 binary.",

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\n---\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\n---\nCourse Materials:\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas. Please do note that the course materials should be used for personal studying purpose. This means you must not upload or share them onto the public sites such as Facebook, Google sites and so on.\nMain references\nThe following two books will be used in the course depending on the topics of interest.\n[1].

If so, to what extent? What are the factors causing it? And what are we willing to give up to stop it? This introductory course offers students a first touch in economics as an economist, not a student. Rather than consider hypothetical situations related to climate change, we will actually compute the empirical realities. In this course we will put economics in the context of how it analyzes and addresses real-world issues such as inequality, discrimination, and sustainability through the interplay of data and theory. While this course will be challenging, no prior knowledge of economics, statistics, or computer programming is assumed.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course, students will be able to:\nExplain Economics notions such as capitalism, fairness, and rationality\nConduct empirical research using Excel and/or R\n Analyze labour and goods markets using appropriate economic models\nEvaluate different public policy approaches to correcting incomplete markets\nDebate contemporary ideas in economic thought and research\n---\nRequired Books\nRequired Books \nDuring our course, we will use two different textbooks.

Through the Fulbright Scholar Development program, these students will earn 4 credits, equivalent to one full-time course, as they complete this academic internship. \nThese student scholars will engage in a variety of tasks and activities intended to provide them with a holistic academic experience. Much of the experience will revolve around the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. Student scholars will create materials, support lectures, run tutorials, aid with experiments, and participate in weekly meetings and online discussions.  \nIn addition to running this course with Graeme, student scholars will also have the opportunity to develop their own research ideas based on lessons from the course. For each topic covered in Principles of Economics I, student scholars will be given additional readings and resources intended to deepen their knowledge on the topic and provoke research ideas. \nAt the end of the Fall term, student scholars will submit either a literature review or project proposal. Student scholars will also have to complete a reflection on the experience. \n---\nLearning Objectives: By the end of the Fall term, student scholars will be able to:\n\u2022 clearly communicate theoretical and methodological approaches to economic issues\n\u2022 use strategies and instructional methods to effectively lead small groups in discussions and activities\n\u2022 formulate research questions founded in economic theory\n\u2022 evaluate and test theoretical models\n\u2022 analyze and interpret experimental data\n---\nExpected Workload:\nStudent scholars will begin working with Graeme during the week of September 27, 2021 to help prepare for the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. From the week of September 27 to October 15, student time will be divided between meetings, workshops, and course set-up as follows:\nMeetings (2 hrs/week): Meetings during these three weeks will be devoted to getting organized and checking in on progress with activities related to setting up the course. Each week there will be a one-hour meeting with all students as well as meetings with sub-groups of students working on different aspects of the course.\nWorkshops (2 hrs/week): Each week we will hold a two-hour teaching workshop where students will lead portions of lessons or activities that they have helped develop. During these sessions, all students will participate and Graeme will provide feedback on the delivery of the lessons/activities. The goal of these workshops is to help students become comfortable leading small groups through online activities.\nCourse Set-up (6 hrs/week): Student scholars may be asked to update slides, create reading lists, develop homework documents, and set-up Canvas. Student scholars will be assigned various topics from the course and asked to work either individually or in small groups to ensure all materials needed for the course are ready before the Fall term begins. Once the Fall term begins, from the week of October 17, 2021 until January 14, 2022, student scholars will be spend their time in class, meetings, office hours, and on research-related activities, as follows:\nClass Time (3 hrs/week): Principles of Economics I will have class on Monday and Wednesday. Each session will run for 90 minutes. Monday\u2019s session will be run by Graeme while Wednesday\u2019s session will be primarily run by student scholars as tutorials. These tutorials will primarily address the weekly homework, but may also involve discussion-based activities that student scholars will facilitate.\nMeetings (2 hr/week): We will meet once per week for two hours. During this time we will debrief on the week\u2019s lecture and tutorial, prepare for the following week\u2019s lesson, and discuss the related literature on the coming topics.\nOffice Hours (1 hr/week): Each student scholar will be required to hold one office hour per week. During these times, students from Principle of Economics I can ask questions related to their weekly homework.\nResearch (4 hrs/week): Each week, student scholars will engage in research activities related to a topic from the coming lesson. The goal is to give the student scholar a deeper understanding of some of the research on a specific topic. For example, in the second week we will discuss capitalism as an economic system. The specific research we may investigate could be based on studies comparing contemporary economic behaviour in the former countries of East and West Germany.\nWeekly research activities may include, but are not limited to, constructing bibliographies, engaging in online discussion groups, presenting readings, and analyzing data. Online discussion groups will allow student scholars to collaborate on weekly research topics to organize readings and share important findings. Student scholars may be asked to present some of what they have learned during weekly meetings.\nBy the end of the week of January 14, 2022, student scholars will have to submit either a project proposal or literature review as well as a reflection.\n---\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass",

Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical \u2018moments\u2019, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion. The course is structured in four major units as follows:\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region's history. By extension, we will step outside of our usual ways of thinking about ethics, politics, and religion and develop a new appreciation for their historical contingency.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nLecture Quizzes: 10%\nMapmaking assignment: 5%\nDiscussion participation: 10%\nUnit Reviews: 40%\nMid-term Exam: 15%\nFinal Exam: 20%",

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\n---\nLectures: All lectures are pre-recorded and online. Two weekly lectures will be posted every Friday night at 22:00 EDT on Canvas. You must watch these lectures BEFORE your weekly team meeting. Each lecture is about an hour long. Plan accordingly.\nTextbook: Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, 6th edition, volume 2\nReadings: The readings consist of a textbook (Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, 6th edition, volume 2). The function of the text is to elaborate on detail and concepts raised in lectures. This book was written specifically for this course by a team of largely Princeton-based authors who have taught this course. In addition, each week we will be posting primary historical documents on Canvas.

It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world?

The course starts with pre-modern and early modern theorists from East and West like Thucydides, Confucius, Machiavelli, Grotius, Kant, and Hobbes. We go on to explore the development of the first modern International Relations theories at the turn of the 20th century, including Marxism, Classical Liberalism, Classical Realism. We then retrace how Neo-Liberalism and Neo-Realism fought for dominance during the Cold War. Finally, we get to the present era where Critical Theory, Constructivism, Neo-Functionalism, and Intergovernmentalism are now challenging older paradigms and bringing new voices to the International Relations debate. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nStudents will be introduced to the most influential International Relations theories.\nStudents will apply their knowledge of the historical, socio-political, and personal context behind the development of International Relations theories to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each school of thought.\nStudents will apply this knowledge to analyze present-day problems in international relations.\nStudents will develop critical thinking and argumentative writing skills to synthesize their own philosophy of international relations.\n---\nTentative Schedule & Readings:\nRecommended background reading, especially for students unfamiliar with world history: Paul Kennedy, Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\nWeek#: Introduction\nIntroduction to the course\nWeek#: Confucius and Mencius in pre-imperial China\nHow did the political fragmentation of China during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period shape Confucius\u2019 and Mencius\u2019 ideas about inter-state relations?\nYuri Pines, Foundations of Confucian Thought, Introduction, Chapter 4\nDavid Kang, \u201cHierarchy and Legitimacy in International Systems: The Tribute System in Early Modern East Asia\u201d; Sungmoon Kim, \u201cMencius on International Relations and the morality of war: From the perspective of Confucian \u2018Moralpolitik\u2019\u201d\nWeek#: Thucydides in Classical Greece\nDid Thucydides really believe in \u201cThucydides\u2019 Trap\u201d?\nGraham Allison, \u201cThe Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?\u201d https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/; James Lee, \u201cDid Thucydides Believe in Thucydides\u2019 Trap?\u201d\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Chapters I-V, XVII-XVIII, XXIII https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7142/7142-h/7142-h.htm\nWeek#: Machiavelli in the Italian Renaissance\nTo what extent was Machiavelli \u201cMachiavellian\u201d?\nJames Hankins, Virtue Politics: Soulcraft and Statecraft in Renaissance Italy, Chapters I-III\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, The Prince https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm; Discourses on Livy, Book II http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10827/pg10827-images.html\nWeek#: Grotius vs. Selden in the Age of Discovery\nHow did imperial rivalry in the 17th century shape the foundations of the modern Law of the Sea?\nPeter Borschberg, \u201cThe Seizure of the Sta.

Students will be expected to have a general knowledge of modern European history.\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nFormat: Online\n---\nCourse Description: In the aftermath of the Second World War, European civilization lay in ruins. Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\n---\nCourse Outline: Link\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\n1.

How about having a computer done chemistry? In fact, computers and data science have been applied to solve a range of problems in science, especially since the booming of quantum theories in 1930s. The course will progressively build from foundational questions and theories of atoms, molecules, and materials to the use of computing power in addressing quantum problems and big data related issues. That includes, but not limited to, designing an innovative drug, calculating and predicting molecular properties, visualizing a chemical reaction in atomic levels, or solving a set of differential equations to understand electron spinning in atoms and molecules. Using project- and inquiry-based approaches, fundamental laws, concepts and calculations in physics and chemistry will be introduced, such as Molecular Orbital Theory, Hartree Fock Theory, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Descriptors and Machine Learning in chemistry.

We will read for elements of comedy that are strange as well as familiar, and we will search for them in likely and unlikely places: in ancient philosophy as well as farcical plays; in canonical religious texts as well as medieval and modern burlesques; in satirical journalism as well as in folk humor. We will consider how laughter has been used to undermine institutions of power, how it has been variously understood as sacred or as profane, how it has managed to vocalize taboo topics in its different cultural manifestations, and how it has been associated with everything from ritual madness to modern pathologies, from wit to buffoonery, from low art to high.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon course completion, students:\n Will be able to identify major comic traditions and their social and historical contexts, formal elements, and interrelationships.\nWill be able to critically evaluate key problems in theories of comedy\n Will be able to apply theories of comedy in analyses of literary texts\nWill be able to engage in effective and sound written and spoken analysis of literary and theoretical texts.\n---\nAssessments:\n3 literary analysis research papers\nParticipation in class discussions\nWeekly reading responses to be posted in Canvas discussion",

Wilks said that one dat skills of statistical thinking will be as important as the skills of reading and writing. This time is here. The purpose of this course is to introduce the key statistical and non-statistical concepts for developing statistical thinking - the essential skills to analyse data, situations and environments objectively. The key statistical concepts introduced during the course are sampling theory, missing data, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and a brief introduction to casual Inference. Furthermore, students develop conceptual knowledge on designing empirical studies and formulating research questions. The course is organized in an interactive way and comprises a mixture of lectures, discussions and teamwork. The course is built on the teaching philosophy of experiential learning, following the 'deep-learning' approach. Students are assessed by their in-class participation, in-class short tests, weekly homework, and final written assignment.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUnderstand basic statistical concepts and methods\nBe able to identify variables and choose suitable statistical model for real world data\nBe able to write simple Python program to utilize statistical tools on real data sets\nBe able to interpret statistical outcomes and draw appropriate conclusion for real world models.\n---\nAssessments:\nWeekly homework (theory and practical coding)\nQuizzes\nGroup presentation\nFinal project",

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\n---\nSyllabus\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\nReadings:\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

It begins by examining what means to represent (literally, re-present) or \u201ctell about\u201d social life, the various ways this has been and can be done, and the challenges we face in doing so in a way that brings value to the social settings and relations within which we work and live. It does so first by examining and comparing various genres of social representation and then distinguishing the social sciences as a distinctive if internally diverse set of approaches to understanding aspects of \"society\" or social life. To do this, the course offers a comparative introduction to traditions of social inquiry spanning the fields of sociology, political economy, economics, \"political science,\" and anthropology. Finally, the course considers the value and limitations of single-discipline only approaches to understanding the social world and the promise and challenges of a more transdisciplinary approach.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: \nExplain in generic terms what it means to \u201ctell about\u201d or \u201crepresent\u201d \u201csociety.\u201d\nDistinguish social sciences from other genres of social representation.\nMake distinctions among major traditions of inquiry and ideas in the social sciences.\nGenerate questions and analyze issues from different disciplinary perspectives.\nBring multiple social scientific and other perspectives on a social issue of interest. \n---\nCourse Outline\n1. Inquiry, Understanding, and Explanation: What the social sciences aim to do.\n2. Telling about society: For whom, and to what end?\n3. Ways of telling about society: From to H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng to T\u00e1o Qu\u00e2n 2021\n4. How the social sciences differ from journalism and why it (sometimes) matters.\n5.

Ethnography refers to both a process of doing ethnography and a written product. In doing ethnography, a researcher actively participates in the group in order to gain an insider\u2019s perspective of the group and to have experiences similar to the group members. In writing ethnography, a researcher narrates observations of the group based on this participation, interviews with group members, and an analysis of group documents and artifacts. This course is designed to provide students with an overview of ethnography and the ethnographic research process, including formulating research questions, finding sources and data, evaluating and critiquing qualitative data including field notes and interview transcripts, and writing an ethnographic report. The course explores crucial aspects of preparing for, realizing and evaluating ethnographic fieldwork.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\nAppraise the quality of ethnographic research;\nAppreciate the role personal and theoretical knowledge play in conducting ethnographic research;\nComprehend the way ethnographic data is collected and interpreted; and,\nWrite and present ethnographic research reports.\n---\nAssessments:\nClass participation (20%)\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\nFinal essay (30%)",

Drawing on a sociological approach, the course emphasizes political economy\u2019s social foundations and seeks to equip students with the ideas and skills needed to develop an informed analysis of some the most important social, political, economic, and cultural debates of our times. Rather than endorsing any one perspective on economy and society, the course surveys and combines multiple perspectives, drawing from ideas and concepts from various intellectual traditions spanning the fields of economics, sociology, politics, and anthropology. The course explores the strengths and weaknesses of these various traditions. In doing so, the course invites students to appreciate that, whatever our preferred explanatory frame or favored theory may be, no single perspective or intellectual standpoint is likely to be wholly sufficient for understanding or explaining actually existing economies. Rather than dwelling on abstractions, the course addresses real world problems and themes.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nExplain key concepts and theoretical approaches in classical, contemporary political economy.\nDevelop comparative perspectives on course themes addressed in a variety of settings.\nCollect and use data to make or explore claims about variety of political economy themes.\nCompare features of Vietnam\u2019s economy with other countries in the region and the world.\n---\nCourse Outline:\n1. Foundations of Political Economy  \nWhat is an economy? The social bases of economies and economic aspects of life.\n\n2. What is capitalism, how it performing, and why is it destroying the planet?\nMarket economies: Assessing their merits vis-\u00e0-vis wellbeing, environment.\n\n3. Theorizing Political Economy: Understanding economies as social wholes.\n Theoretical traditions in political economy, their contributions, limits, and relevance.\n\n4. Actors, Institutions, and Organizations \n Making sense of economies: who are the main actors and what shapes their behavior?\n\n5. Ideas, Interests, and the State\n The state\u2019s status as rule maker/enforcer makes it a unique if not always capable actor.\n\n6. Growth and Productivity, Welfare and Precarity \n Why productivity is crucial and why its connection to human wellbeing is contingent. \n\n7. Social Inequalities, Work, and Class \n Social inequality is ubiquitous and not intrinsically bad, but it have harmful effects. \n\n8. Opportunities and Life Chances in Actually Existing Economies.\n Why the accident of birth, labeling, and patterns of group membership shape life chances. \n\n9. What is Social Reproduction?\n Economies depend on the reproduction of labor and lots of paid and unpaid work.\n\n10. What is Social Policy?\nSocial policies are an essential feature of any contemporary economy.\n\n11. Analyzing \u2018Varieties of Capitalism\u2019 \n Comparing OECD countries: economic governance and welfare regimes.\n\n12.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human. As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.). As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.\n---\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this class, students will be able to:\nDesign and produce an ethnographic text through writing a mini-ethnography which includes a literature review section\nApply qualitative anthropological methods to analyze communication and community over new media.\nUnderstand core concepts in digital anthropology\nSelect, read, and synthesize secondary sources based on research interests\nReflect upon their own online experiences and identity formation.\n---\nReading Guides\nReading guides are available to help you work with these texts.

A prevailing perception regards Asian women \u2013 especially those highly educated or from powerful families \u2013 as socio-politically as well or even better than their male counterparts. Yet there is little understanding of the history, nature, and challenge of Asian women\u2019s struggle to exercise their political agency. This course offers students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of women and politics in Asia and to explore the significance of gender in politics of the past, present, and future. The course also examines various factors, trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political advancement in contemporary Asia. This course aims to familiarize students with a broad range of issues involving women and politics in Asia \u2013 the political participation of women; the history of women\u2019s movements; political divisions among women; and what we mean when we refer to \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d at home, at work, and in political institutions. Because women\u2019s involvement in the political arena is informed by their roles and status at home and in society at large, the course will also examine sociological, anthropological, and feminist research on such topics as inequality, power, discrimination, and social norms. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning women in Vietnam and Asia.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\nComprehend various institutional, cultural and personal factors, as well as distinctive trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political engagement in Vietnam and Asia;\nUse basic concepts and theories of women and politics;\nRead critically the literature and other materials;\nWrite and present academic research reports; and,\nReflect upon women in politics and society of Vietnam and Asia.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nClass participation (20%)\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\nFinal essay (30%)",

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Nguyen Thanh Trung - E: trung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\nPre-requisite(s): No\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nCourse Format: Online\n---\nCourse Description: This course provides an overview of theoretical and empirical research on social movements contextualized in Vietnam. It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam's nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\n---\nSyllabus\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\nTilly, Charles.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Web-based talks and conversations with representative scholars in Vietnamese Studies from North America, Europe, East- and Southeast Asia will help students recognize the global aspects of this fascinating academic field. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. At the end of the course, students are encouraged to work in team on a research topic of their choice with transdisciplinary approaches. This course is open to VSM majors and non-majors.  \n---\nLearning Objectives: After finishing this course, students should be able to \n- Recognize the importance of Vietnam Studies from a variety of perspectives;\n- Obtain a general view of Vietnam Studies as it is practiced widely and differently in Vietnam as well in the rest of the world, thus get ready for their graduate studies;\n- Get connected with leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\n- How to contextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\n- How to identify a substantial and meaningful Vietnam-based research topic that can trigger international interests;\n- Locate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam; \n- Apply transdisciplinary approaches to their research.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nAttendance & participation (10%)\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\n(re)sources survey (20%)\nFinal team project (40%)",

Originated from Buddhism but now practiced out of their Buddhist philosophical/ontological contexts, they seem to establish certain living styles habitually described as \u201cpositive,\u201d or \u201cconscious,\u201d but at the same time, are running the risk of going against what the Buddha taught. Thus, to better understand those concepts and put them back into practice more effectively, one cannot but return to their root which is Buddhism. Buddhist ethics (\u201cethics\u201d here can be simply defined as a system of moral principles) undoubtedly plays a crucial role in Vietnamese moral life.\nIn Vietnam as well as elsewhere, one of the causes that create generation gaps between parents and children is the fact that they are living with/practicing not the same ethical values. A common ethical ground must be first founded to bridge the gaps, to ensure mutual understanding between the individual and her/his ever-expanded communal networks, starting with the family (as the core of society), to community (such as hamlet or village), nation, and finally to the world (natural world included). With the whole-person education framework, the Fulbright University Viet Nam aims to develop its graduates not only as young promising professionals in their fields, but also as moral citizens who can significantly contribute to society in contemporary Vietnamese and global contexts. Such a goal surely cannot be achieved in the absence of moral principles (or ethics).\nThrough reading assignments, guest lectures given by Vietnamese and international scholars as well as religious practitioners, and field study trips, students of this course will be exposed to various Buddhist traditions performed in Vietnam, East- and Southeast Asian regions. Films, literature, and newspapers will serve as the main sources for case studies and reference. Service learning is also required as an integral part of the course.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nAfter finishing the course, students should be able to:\n* Acquire a general understanding of Buddhism and its key concepts, moral values, practices, and movements in various regional settings of East- and Southeast Asia, with a focus on Vietnam.\n* Identify similarities and differences between Western concepts of \u201cethics\u201d and particular aspects of Buddhist ethics.\n* Recognize Buddhist ethical values practiced in Vietnam and neighboring countries, and refer to Buddhist moral principles as a reference in their daily life.\n* Explain the rise, popularity, and importance of certain social practices deeply rooted in Buddhism (such as \u201cMindfulness\u201d or \u201cLoving kindness\u201d) around the world, particularly in contemporary Vietnam.\n* Appreciate Buddhist ethics as an effective way for self-cultivation to become a whole person, a good citizen, and a responsible professional.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nAttendance & participation (10%)\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\nService-learning (20%) \u2013 to be discussed with students\nFinal team project (40%)",
