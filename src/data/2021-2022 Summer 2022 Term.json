Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero.

    "description": "Category: Core\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No\nFormat: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: We learn across the Fulbright Core how transformations have happened in human history \u2013 transformations in thought, in social structures, and in individual lives. We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n ---\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:  \nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected. An important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node. The theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context. One of the innovations of this course is related to coupling the idea of sustainability with Bionic Theory (a.k.a. Biomimicry) used in urban design, architecture and structures. In the Bionic approach the students will select a preferred natural process and investigate the system and the inner rules of the natural elements. They will understand how the nature works, analyzing the mathematical and physical process of the nature. Finally they will realize physical models to express how the natural systems work. During the Bionic Design phase, the students will use the results of the investigation produced in the first phase and finally they will produce a project of sustainable urban Eco-District, Eco-Village or architecture. The logic is to direct the students in the use of the bionic process in the design in order to create sustainable systems.",

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Philip Taylor\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No\nCourse Format: On-campus\nCross-listed: Social Science (SOCI), Economics (ECON), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\n---\nCourse Description: Development in Vietnam is a grand yet unfinished project: many ethnic minorities and upland communities remain poor; people in remote localities and marginal social positions risk being left behind. Such bleak outcomes are sometimes attributed to the \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 customs, beliefs and habits of people who adhere to traditional lifeways, religious values, or ethnic preferences that are seen as obstacles to change. This critique has inspired efforts to simplify or eliminate diverse local traditions and practices, on the grounds that they pose barriers to development and human improvement. Yet such efforts have, in turn, led target groups to resist development, for instance by clinging with renewed vigour to the past, or to claims of innate difference, or holding out hope for miraculous salvation. The sheer diversity of indigenous cultures in Vietnam is a thorny challenge for a country that is serious about the objective of inclusive development. \nThis course takes a different tack in examining diversity as a potential resource for development. Critical of top-down development, which often proceeds in ignorance of what works locally, it explores the myriad ways that ordinary Vietnamese people have contributed, in their own manner, to development in their country. In numerous localities, people have achieved a measure of economic growth, intellectual development, material security, social cohesion, and inclusion by drawing on non-conventional resources such as spiritual capital, ethnic networks, traditional kinship, indigenous gender ideologies, communal bonds, myth, local memory, or religious morality. In so doing they neither resist change, nor abandon their traditions, but instead mobilize time-honoured capacities and logics to chart an indigenous path to development. The course reviews a selection of influential development theories and introduces fascinating case studies drawn from a variety of localities in Vietnam that were generated with ethnographic methods. The case studies open eyes to the multitude of development challenges Vietnam faces but also the rich fund of indigenous experiences and capacities currently being activated by ordinary people in numerous places to solve their diverse problems as examples of \u2018development from below\u2019.
